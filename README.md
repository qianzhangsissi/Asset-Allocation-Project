# Asset-Allocation-Project
In this exercise, we will go through the following steps:
1. Load Aswath Damodaranâ€™s data: We will use historical return data on stocks, bonds, and bills from the United States available at Aswath Damodaran's website.
2. Get risky asset excess returns for stocks and bonds: We will calculate excess returns for stocks and bonds over the risk-free rate (3-month T.Bill).
3. Calculate the MVP and MSRP using Python Optimization Package: We will use the scipy.optimize package to calculate the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) and the Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio (MSRP). Note that there are various Python optimization packages available. We can explore other professional packages for Operation Research at Python for Operations Research.
4. Get the risky asset frontier with different weights on MVP: Finally, we will visualize the risky asset frontier by plotting the relationship between the weights on the MVP and the resulting portfolio risk and return.
